Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on our progress with the recent data conversion project from JSON to CSV format and loading the data int data warehouse I want address some key points regarding 
data quality and our approach to ensure a smooth and reliable process.

- There are several missing values in the pointsAwardedDate and finishedDate fields. I need to determine if these should be filled with default values, estimated values, or left as null.
- While processing the JSON data, several KeyErrors were raised, indicating that some records were missing expected fields such as finishedDate and pointsAwardedDate
- I need to know if there is a preferred method for handling missing values in fields like pointsAwardedDate and finishedDate. Should I use default values, estimate them, or leave them as null?
- Detailed requirements for the final CSV format, including the order of columns and any specific naming conventions, would ensure that the output meets the required standards.
- To prevent the data export process from becoming a bottleneck, I will optimize the CSV writing process by using buffered I/O and efficient data structures

We are committed to ensuring that the final data assets are accurate, reliable, and optimized for your needs. Your feedback and any additional requirements you might have are crucial at this stage.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need further details on our approach.


Best Regards,
Chandana N
